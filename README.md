## Introduction

The Airbnb Geospatial Analysis project provides users with tools to analyze Airbnb data from various countries and cities. It offers features such as:

- Geospatial analysis to visualize Airbnb listings on a map.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding price distributions, top hotels, and more.
- Recommendations based on user-defined criteria, including price range.

## Domain 
Travel Industry, Property management and Tourism

## Problem_Statement 
  This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

## Libraries
### Libraries/Modules needed for the project!
- Plotly, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)
- Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
- Pymongo - (To store and retrieve the data by connecting with MongoDB Atlas)
- Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)

## Workflow :

#### Step 1 :
  Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. 
#### Step 2 : 
  Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
#### Step 3 :
  Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
#### Step 4 :
  Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.
#### Step 5 :
  Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.

## Conclusions
Through this exploratory data analysis and visualization project, we gained several interesting insights into the Airbnb rental market. Below we will summarise the answers to the questions that we wished to answer at the beginning of the project:

How do prices of listings vary by location? What localities in Countries are rated highly by guests? Manhattan has the most expensive rentals compared to the other boroughs. Prices are higher for rentals closer to city hotspots. Rentals that are rated highly on the location by the host also have higher prices
